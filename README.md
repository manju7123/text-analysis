# **Real-Time Text Analysis and String Replacement**

A React-based web application that performs real-time text analysis on user input. The app displays the number of unique words, counts characters (excluding spaces and punctuation), and provides functionality to dynamically replace specified strings within the text. The replaced words are also highlighted.

## **Features**

- **Unique Word Count**: Displays the number of unique words entered, case-insensitive.
- **Character Count**: Provides the number of characters excluding spaces and punctuation.
- **String Replacement**: Replace all occurrences of a given string with another string.
- **Highlighted Replacements**: After replacement, highlights the replaced words.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
